<h2>Why am I doing this</h2>
<p>I've always been captivated by coding and the prospect of creating my own website from start to finish. I figure it's never too late to start something new, especially 
    something that interests and fascinates me so much. Even if this project doesn't amount to anything other than learning a new skill, I will be happy knowing 
    I have finally achieved this life goal.
